# AI-Enhanced-Nutrition-Assistant-Personalized-Dietary-Feedback-Based-on-Food-Restrictions
AI-powered web system providing personalized diet and recipe recommendations based on users' health conditions and dietary restrictions.
This project is an AI-driven web application designed to offer customized meal and recipe suggestions for individuals with specific diseases or nutritional limitations. By analyzing user health data and food composition, the system intelligently recommends suitable dishes using a combination of Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Deep Learning (DL) techniques.

A Python (FastAPI) backend serves as the intelligent API that powers the recommendation logic, while a PHP-based frontend provides an interactive and user-friendly interface.
Due to GitHub’s file size restrictions, the pre-trained model directory (saved_model_large/) and the ontology file (FoodOn.owl) could not be uploaded. However, all essential source codes, database files, and embedded vectors (recipe_embeddings.pkl) are included, ensuring that the system’s architecture and functionality can be fully understood and reproduced.
