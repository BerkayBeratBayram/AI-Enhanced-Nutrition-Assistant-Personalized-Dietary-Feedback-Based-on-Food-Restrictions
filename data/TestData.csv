""Add the well-mashed banana to the bowl with the rest of the wet ingredients and mix until combined.  Sometimes I break the bananas into chunks and pop them into the Magic Bullet for 2 seconds instead of mashing them because I'm lazy like that.  Overripe bananas provide the sweetness to these muffins.  Using frozen bananas (defrosted before being mashed) adds a ton of moisture to this recipe.   Frozen, overripe bananas are great to have on hand.  You can use overripe (not frozen) bananas and this recipe will still work out.  It's pretty forgiving that way.  Even if you bananas are yellow they will work, but you'll have to try this recipe in the future when you have your frozen overripe bananas ready and you'll see what I mean.  It takes it to a whole new level!"", 
""In a circular motion, pour the wet ingredients into the bowl of dry ingredients.  Instead of just dumping the wet ingredients in I like to pour it around because apparently too much mixing of muffin batter will make them hard (dense) and starting off with a somewhat even coat of wet on top of dry will allow for less mixing and, therefore, lighter muffins.  But, hey, if you want to knock yourself out and dump it all in then go for it!  Don't let me cramp your style, but if you do that, then please don't say my muffin recipe leads to dense muffins  :)."", 
""Mix with a spoon until the wet and dry ingredients are blended.  Try not to stir them too much, but just enough until the ingredients are mixed.  Let it stand for roughly 2 to 3 minutes. I like doing this because it gives a little bit of time for the oat bran to moisten up a tiny bit more.  I usually set the bowl aside while I get the muffin cups ready.  I have a hard time separating those little buggers so by the time the cups are ready it's been about 2 minutes.  After the batter sits for just a few minutes, it's now time to start filling the pan which will be described in the step below."", 
""These muffins don't rise very much.  Maybe about a 1/4 inch to a maximum of 1/2 inch. Fill your muffin cups accordingly.  I usually get anywhere from 14 to 16 medium muffins.  You can get 12 large ones.  I'm not fancy so I use a soup spoon and heap it up with batter to fill each cup.  I've heard of people using ice cream scoops and go for it if you have one on hand. I don't like doing dishes too much so the soup spoon I used to mix the ingredients words great for me!
Place the muffin pan on the middle rack and bake at 375 for 20 to 25 minutes or until the tops starts to brown just a tad and a toothpick comes out clean.  Make sure to keep an eye on these babies because every oven is different.  I put on a timer, but if it hasn't gone off yet and I start smelling them from the next room I'll go take a quick peak."", 
""Once they are done, remove from the oven. Put the individual muffins onto a cooling rack so that the bottoms do not continue cooking and get hard.  The muffin top will have a nice crunch and the inside will be nice and moist with bursts of sweetness coming from the apple pieces.  The oat bran will have the consistency of cooked steel oats; a chewy texture.  Yum!  Now, keep in mind that the integrity of these muffins are to be healthy, so don't be expecting the sweetness and gooey, cakey insides like what you would get out of a chocolate chip muffin or banana bread muffin.  If you don't care about the health factor then go ahead and add some chocolate chips and sugars.  I won't be offended!

""Step 18: A wooden box is best for storing the noodles, but if one is not available, use a metal tray lined with wax paper (to prevent sticking) and store in the refrigerator.
Step 19: 2 hours after the pork bones have started simmering, the soup should become progressively white and cloudy. If tasted at this stage, the soup will not taste good since it will still have a raw flavor.
Step 20: After the soup has simmered for 6 hours, The inside of the bones should now be empty and the soup should have a rich smell just like a ramen place."", 
""The stock is rich. It exactly like the picture, itâ€™s not a clear stock at all. Just remember that it wonâ€™t have much taste right now because thereâ€™s no salt. But donâ€™t adjust the seasoning until the end of the recipe because youâ€™re adding soy sauce to the ramen base.
Step 21: The char siu should be a nice amber color. Slice with care since it will be very tender and tend to fall apart.
Step 22: Any leftovers can be eaten with beer.
LOL But I will add that if you ever have trouble slicing soft pork, chill the whole piece in the refrigerator until cold, and it makes slicing easier. Reheating is easy, in either the microwave or oven, even stove top."", 
""Step 23: Itâ€™s time to put everything together. Since boiling time can differ, boil the noodles to each personâ€™s preference. For people who like curly noodles, firmly squeeze the noodles until the desired effect is achieved.
Step 24: Warm the bowl, and add the char siu sauce and salt for flavor. Use sparingly at first and then add more if desired.
Step 25: I prefer to boil the noodles for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Your rich and hearty tonkotsu ramen is complete.
Notes:
Okay, because final assembly occurred, I prepared some soy sauce marinated eggs the night before."", 
""Hereâ€™s what I did:
Ingredients:
12 eggs in shells.
Diced pork hock meat (leftovers from recipe above) 1 lb.
3 green onions cut into 1 inch pieces.
1 thumb sized piece of ginger sliced.
2 large cloves of garlic sliced.
1/2 cup soy sauce.
2 Tablespoons cooking wine/sake/sherry.
2 Tablespoons Sugar.
1/2 cup water.
Step 1: Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil. (Using a small thumb tack, I prick a pin hole in the base (fat end) of every egg, but thatâ€™s not necessary.) The the water is at a full boil, I put the eggs inches The water should cover the eggs. Wait for the water to come back to a full boil, and time for 7 minutes. (9 minutes will give you a fully hard boiled egg. 7 minutes is a very soft boiled egg.) Drain the pot and eggs and plunge the eggs in ice water to stop cooking. This also makes the shells a bit easier to peel."", 
""Step 2: In a small pot, saute pork, garlic, onions, and ginger until slightly browned. Add soy sauce, cooking alcohol, sugar, water and simmer for 10 minutes. Until pork is cooked through and flavors meld. Remove from stove. Remove pork to eat separately. Pour everything else into a bowl large enough to hold marinade and eggs.
Step 3: Carefully, peel the eggs, and place in marinade. Try to make sure the marinade covers all of the eggs. If not, try transferring the sauce into a large ZipLock bag, and place the eggs in the bag and seal. Place the bag in a bowl, and put everything in the refrigerator overnight. Or at least for a few hours."",

Step 2 â€“ Add COLD water to the pot. Hot sink water will contain more impurities than cold sink water. Use a big enough pot that will hold the water and pasta. Make sure it has a large base so that the water will boil faster. This is a pretty easy step.
Step 3 â€“ Bring the water to a fast, raging boil. Also, add a little bit of salt to the water (about 1-2 tablespoons) but donâ€™t add any olive oil! This will season the pasta as well as quicken the time for the water to boil."", 
""Step 4 â€“ Add the pasta to the water and do NOT cover with a lid. Also, do not add the pasta until Step 3 is reached and make sure the water is back to boiling after the pasta is added. Start your timer after the water reaches a boil again.
Step 5 â€“ After 1 minute, give the pasta a stir. After that leave it alone!
Step 6 â€“ Test your pasta after 4 minutes. The proper amount of time it takes to cook pasta â€œal dente,â€ or tender but firm, varies for all the different types of pastas. So keep testing your pasta every minute from here on out. The entire time to cook should probably it between 8 to 12 minutes."", 
""Step 7 â€“ Once the pasta is â€œal dente,â€ remove it from the heat and drain it immediately into a colander to stop the cooking process. If you wait too long, your pasta will over cook and become too mushy. If for some strange, unforeseen reason, you canâ€™t immediately do this, add about 1/2 to 1 cup of cold water to the pot. This will lower the temperature enough to stop the cooking.
Step 8 â€“ Donâ€™t over drain the pasta, it should still remain moist. Also, NEVER RINSE OFF THE PASTA! Unless the recipe calls for it. After you have drained the pasta, return it to the pot or a pan and add whatever sauce you made to it. This will keep the pasta from sticking together."",

Peel the apples, core them then cut them up thing using your thin slice blade on your food processor. Put in a big bowl.
Add the tapioca, powdered sweetener, turbinado sugar, ground cinnamon and lemon juice.  Mix really well to distribute all the ingredients and coat the apples. Set aside.
Preheat your oven to 425'F.
FOR THE CRUST:
As I said above, I make one crust at a time.  This works much better then making two and trying to divide them evenly.  I never seem to be able to get them exact.  This recipe is just for one crust, I haven't made both crusts at once."", 
""Put the flour and salt in the food processor, pulse it a few times to combine the ingredients and fluff up the flour.
Add the shortening and pulse to distribute.  Add the cream cheese and pulse a few more times.  You should have a course pebble texture when done.
Open the food processor and feel the dough.  If its soft, but not sticky and stays together then its ready.  However, if its a bit crumbly add a little cold water at a time and stop the machine, continue to feel the dough.  Once it sticks together nicely its ready."", 
""Because I used non-dairy cream cheese I didn't even need to add the water.  There was enough moisture in it as it was.
Turn the dough out onto a board and form it into a disc. Refrigerate the disc while you make the second crust.  You can refrigerate the second disc for about 20 minutes if you wish.  This will make it much easier to handle.
Roll out the first disc to about 2 inches wider then your pie plate.  Put the rolled dough into the plate and carefully press it down into the plate making sure all the air pockets are gone."", 
""Add the apple pie filling. Dab the goat's butter on top of the apples.

You will need a pizza stone or solid baking sheet measuring 14 x 11 inches (35 x 28 cm).
Warm the flour slightly in the oven for about 10 minutes, then turn the oven off. Sift the flour, salt, yeast and sugar into a bowl and make a well in the centre of the mixture, then add the olive oil and pour in 4 fl oz (120 ml) hand-hot water.
Now mix to a dough, starting off with a wooden spoon and using your hands in the final stages of mixing. Wipe the bowl clean with the dough, adding a spot more water if there are any dry bits left, and transfer it to a flat work surface (there shouldn't be any need to flour this). Knead the dough for 3 minutes or until it develops a sheen and blisters under the surface (it should also be springy and elastic). You can now either leave the dough on the surface covered by the upturned bowl or transfer the dough to a clean bowl and cover it with clingfilm that has been lightly oiled on the side that is facing the dough."", 
""Leave it until it looks as though it has doubled in bulk, which will be about an hour at room temperature.
Meanwhile make the sauce: heat the oil in a medium saucepan, then add the garlic and chilli and cook briefly until the garlic is pale gold. Then add all the other sauce ingredients, stir and season with a little pepper â€“ but no salt because of the anchovies.
Turn the heat to low and let the sauce simmer very gently without a lid for 40 minutes, by which time it will have reduced to a lovely, thick mass with very little liquid left."", 
""Pre-heat the oven to gas mark 8, 450Â°F (230Â°C), along with the pizza stone or baking sheet.
The next stage is to tip the dough back on to a work surface that has been sprinkled generously with polenta to prevent it from sticking. Knock all the air out of the dough and knead it for a couple of seconds to begin shaping it into a ball.
Then dust your rolling pin with polenta and roll the dough out to a circle that is approximately 10 inches (25.5 cm) in diameter. Then finish stretching it out with your hands, working from the centre and using the flat of your fingers to push the dough out; it doesn't need to be a perfect round, but you want it to be a fairly thin-based pizza, with slightly raised edges. Place the uncooked base to one side."", 
""Then, using a thick oven glove, very carefully lift the baking sheet or pizza stone out of the oven and sprinkle it with the polenta (cornmeal). Spread the sauce over the pizza base, taking it up to the raised edge, then carefully lift it on to the hot baking sheet or pizza stone. Now scatter the Mozzarella over, then dip the basil leaves in the olive oil and place them here and there on top.
